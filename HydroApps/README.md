# README #

This folder would normally document the hydrological models, both lumped and semi-distributed.

### What includes in SNOWModel ###

* The Fortran 95/2003 code with Visual Studio
* The SNOWModel is self-contained.
* SNOW model is a 2 parameter model, used to simulate the snow melting process

* fitModel.f90 is the main code to setup and call SNOWModel
* SnowMod.f90 is the subroutine for Snow Model
* fitModel.txt is the setup for parameters, data, and warmup period
* InputData.csv is the data, includs rainfall, temperature, simulation, and date 

### What includes in AWBM ###

* The Fortran 95/2003 code with Visual Studio
* The AWBM is self-contained.
* AWBM model is a 8 parameter model, used to simulate the hydrological process

* fitModel.f90 is the main code to setup and call AWBM
* AWBM.f90 is the subroutine for AWBM Model
* fitModel.txt is the setup for parameters, data, and warmup period
* InputData.csv is the data, includs rainfall, temperature, simulation, and date
* AWBM use three paralle tank to simulate the spatial variability of soil moisutre
* AWBM model need careful setting of A1 and A2, otherwise, one cannot locate unique A1 and A2 

### What includes in SIMHYD ###

* The Fortran 95/2003 code with Visual Studio
* The SIMHYD is self-contained.
* SIMHYD model is a three-tanks model, including interception storage, soil moisture tank, and groundwater storage ,with 7 parameters.

* fitModel.f90 is the main code to setup and call AWBM
* SIMHYD.f90 is the subroutine for SIMHYD Model
* fitModel.txt is the setup for parameters, data, and warmup period
* InputData.csv is the data, includs rainfall, temperature, simulation, and date
* SIMHYD use three paralle tank to simulate the spatial variability of soil moisutre
* The two parameter, SQ and COEFF, has been reported to be insensitive

### What includes in SIXPAR ###

* The Fortran 95/2003 code with Visual Studio
* The SIXPAR is self-contained.
* SIXPAR model is a two-tanks model, which maintain the feature of sacramento model.

* fitModel.f90 is the main code to setup and call AWBM
* SIXPAR.f90 is the subroutine for SIXPAR Model
* fitModel.txt is the setup for parameters, data, and warmup period
* InputData.csv is the data, includs rainfall, temperature, simulation, and date
