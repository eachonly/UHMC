# README #

This README would normally document the progress in hydrological modelling, particularly on numerical optimization.

### What is this repository for? ###

* This repository is bulid for sharing the knowledge in hydrological modelling.
* Build on Fortran 95/2003 with Visual Studio

### What includes in this repoistory? ###

* Literatures on Understanding Hydrologic Model Behaviour
* Hydrological Models (lumped and semi-distributed)
* Unit tests (with Data and Results)
* Optimization algorithms

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Writing tests
	
	For those who are interested in using the optimization algorithms, please clone the code;

	For those who want to report a bug, please use the Issue Track system;

	For those who want to contribute (Models and Algorithms), please use the sub-branch.

* Other guidelines
Use master as the main branch, use sub-branch for developmemnt.

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Students/Research major in Hydrology
* Other community who are interested in Numerical Optimization
